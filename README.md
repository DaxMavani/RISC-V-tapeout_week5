## üöÄ About This Repository  
This is my **first GitHub repository** created as part of the **VSD SoC Tapeout Program (IIT Gandhinagar)**.  
Here, I document my **week-by-week progress** ‚Äî from **RTL design to GDSII flow** in VLSI.  

The goal of this program (and this repo) is to:  
- Gain **hands-on experience** with RISC-V SoC design.  
- Learn the **end-to-end physical design flow** of an IC.  
- Contribute toward the vision of **Viksit Bharat** and the **Indian Semiconductor Mission**.
