## üöÄ About This Repository  
This is my **first GitHub repository** created as part of the **VSD SoC Tapeout Program (IIT Gandhinagar)**.  
Here, I document my **week-by-week progress** ‚Äî from **RTL design to GDSII flow** in VLSI.  

The goal of this program (and this repo) is to:  
- Gain **hands-on experience** with RISC-V SoC design.  
- Learn the **end-to-end physical design flow** of an IC.  
- Contribute toward the vision of **Viksit Bharat** and the **Indian Semiconductor Mission**.

## üìÖ Week 2 ‚Äî BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling  

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Part 1** | üß© **SoC Fundamentals & BabySoC Architecture** | Explored the concept of a **System-on-Chip**, its components (CPU, Memory, Peripherals, Interconnect), and how **BabySoC** demonstrates real-world integration using **RVMYTH (RISC-V core)**, **PLL**, and **DAC**. | ‚úÖ Done |
| **Part 2** | ‚öôÔ∏è **Pre-Synthesis Functional Simulation** | Cloned the **VSDBabySoC** repo, compiled Verilog modules with `iverilog`, generated `.vcd` waveforms, and verified correct operation of clock, reset, and dataflow using **GTKWave**. | ‚úÖ Done |
| **Part 3** | üß† **Post-Synthesis Simulation & Validation** | Performed synthesis to obtain gate-level netlist, simulated using `make post_synth_sim`, and verified waveform consistency between RTL and GLS ensuring functional equivalence. | ‚úÖ Done |

**Learning Outcome:**  
Week 2 solidified understanding of **functional modelling** and **simulation methodologies**.  
It showcased how the **BabySoC** serves as a bridge between theoretical SoC design and practical implementation ‚Äî validating both **logic correctness** and **synthesis integrity** before moving toward layout and tapeout.

## üìÖ Week 3 ‚Äî Post Synthesis GLS & STA Fundamentals  

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Part 1** | üé≤ **Post Synthesis of GLS** |Performed the synthesis of BabySoC and Compared GLS output with functional simulation output . | ‚úÖ Done |
| **Part 2** | üî© **Fundamentals of STA** |Completed the STA Fundamental course through Udemy. | ‚úÖ Done |
| **Part 3** | ‚åö **Generate Timing Graphs with OpenSTA** | Loaded synthesized netlist and constraints into OpenSTA and generated the timing graphs. | ‚úÖ Done |

**Learning Outcome:**  
Week 3 solidified understanding of **STA** and **GLS** fundamentals.  
It showcased how the **OpenSTA** is installed and then, used it practically for synthesizing the netlist and getting the timing graphs, which shows the practical hands on experience.



## ‚ú® Closing Note  
This repository is a **living document** of my Tapeout journey.  
Each completed week adds another step toward mastering **open-source VLSI design**.  

> *‚ÄúThe best way to learn VLSI is by doing it ‚Äî one step at a time.‚Äù*
